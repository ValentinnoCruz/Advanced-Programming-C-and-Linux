# Matrix Engine

1. **Introduction**
In mathematics, a matrix (plural of matrices) is a rectangular array—of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns—that is interpreted and manipulated in certain prescribed ways. One such way is to state the dimensions of the matrix. This project is programmed to calculate arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply) of two matrices. It is also able to do more advanced linear functions involving matrices such as transpose, determinant, and inverse of a matrix. Lastly, There is a game implemented to test the users knowledge of matrix problems.

## Summary
This game contains most concepts that we have learned in the class. I have my own Linked List template class which is used in Record Class. There are also file stream and quick sort in Record Class. I use the STL library to get a statistic of all the records. In the Matrix Class, I use recursion to solve the determinant problems. I use the 2-dimention array to store the matrix.
