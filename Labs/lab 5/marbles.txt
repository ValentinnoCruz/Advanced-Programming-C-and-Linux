pick() method picks a marble of random type form the bag. First it checks if the 
is empty or not. If the bag is empty, it return the -1 that indicates the empty 
bag. If the bag doesn't empty, it choose a pick value randomly and check is that
the count of that marble type in types[] array is 0 or not. If 0, it again chooses
a random number and checks again. If the count > 0, it decrements the count of
marble type and decrements the size that tracks how many marbles are there in the
bag. Then it return the type of marble that picked up.

					Part 2
=================================================================================

In the main() function, I followed 4 test cases to check the BagOfMarbles.

Test case 1:
	I put a different number of marbles of each type in the bag and test its
	functionality. It picks up a random marbles form the bag and displays the 
	remaining marbles count and types of marbles after picking up.

Test case 2:
	I put different number of marbles with illegal types (out of range 0-4).
	It should ignore the illegal types of marbles and should track the count 
	accordingly. After putting them into the bag, it prints the types and 
	count of the marbles in the bag that is exactly the count of legal types 
	and it ignores th illegal types and didn't include any illegal type of 
	marble in the bag. After picking up a marble, it tracks the count and size
	correctly.

Test case 3:
	I put 20 marbles all of the type 4. that means picked marble is always of
	type 4. When I run the pick() method, it picks the type 4 marble each time
	and keep the track of marbles and size accordingly.

Test case 4:
	I keep the bag empty and tests the pick() method, it return -1, the indicates 
	the bag is empty.
